"""
Scenario 1: Test to validate the clone method returns the same object

Details:
  TestName: verifyCloneReturnsSameObject
  Description: This test is meant to check if the clone method returns the same object as 'this'. Since the clone method is overridden to simply return 'this', we expect the same object to be returned.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a new object of the class that contains the clone method.
    Act: Invoke the clone method on this object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned object from the clone method with the original object.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the clone method returns the same object as 'this'. The expected result is that the original and cloned object are the same. This test is significant as it ensures that the clone method is functioning as expected and not creating a new instance.

Scenario 2: Test to ensure the clone method does not create a new instance

Details:
  TestName: verifyCloneDoesNotCreateNewInstance
  Description: This test checks if the clone method does not create a new instance. If the clone method were creating new instances, it would defy the purpose of it being overridden to return 'this'.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a new object of the class that contains the clone method.
    Act: Invoke the clone method on this object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the original and cloned objects' hash codes are the same.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the clone method does not create a new instance. The expected result is that the original and cloned object's hash codes are the same. This test is crucial in ensuring that the clone method is not creating unnecessary objects, which could lead to memory leaks.

Scenario 3: Test to check the clone method with multiple invocations

Details:
  TestName: verifyMultipleCloneInvocationsReturnSameObject
  Description: This test checks if multiple invocations of the clone method on the same object return the same object each time.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a new object of the class that contains the clone method.
    Act: Invoke the clone method on this object multiple times.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned objects from each clone method invocation with the original object.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that multiple invocations of the clone method return the same object. The expected result is that all cloned objects are the same as the original. This test is important for ensuring consistency in the behavior of the clone method.
