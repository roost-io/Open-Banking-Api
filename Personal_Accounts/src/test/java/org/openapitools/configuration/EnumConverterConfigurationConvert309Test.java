 * """ Scenario 1: Valid Consent Status Code Conversion
 *
 * Details: TestName: testValidConsentStatusCodeConversion Description: This test is meant
 * to check if the convert method is able to successfully convert a valid string into a
 * ConsentStatusCode. Execution: Arrange: Set up a valid string that corresponds to a
 * ConsentStatusCode. Act: Invoke the convert method with the valid string. Assert: Use
 * JUnit assertions to compare the returned ConsentStatusCode against the expected
 * ConsentStatusCode. Validation: The assertion aims to verify that the conversion of a
 * valid string into a ConsentStatusCode is successful. The expected result is the
 * corresponding ConsentStatusCode because the string is valid and corresponds to a
 * ConsentStatusCode. This test is significant as it verifies the correct functionality of
 * the conversion process.
 *
 * Scenario 2: Invalid Consent Status Code Conversion
 *
 * Details: TestName: testInvalidConsentStatusCodeConversion Description: This test is
 * meant to check if the convert method is able to handle an invalid string that does not
 * correspond to a ConsentStatusCode. Execution: Arrange: Set up an invalid string that
 * does not correspond to a ConsentStatusCode. Act: Invoke the convert method with the
 * invalid string. Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect an exception or an error code.
 * Validation: The assertion aims to verify that the conversion of an invalid string
 * results in an exception or an error code. The expected result is an exception or error
 * because the string is invalid and does not correspond to a ConsentStatusCode. This test
 * is significant as it verifies the error handling capabilities of the conversion
 * process.
 *
 * Scenario 3: Null Consent Status Code Conversion
 *
 * Details: TestName: testNullConsentStatusCodeConversion Description: This test is meant
 * to check if the convert method is able to handle a null string. Execution: Arrange: Set
 * up a null string. Act: Invoke the convert method with the null string. Assert: Use
 * JUnit assertions to expect a null return or an exception. Validation: The assertion
 * aims to verify that the conversion of a null string results in a null return or an
 * exception. The expected result is a null return or an exception because the string is
 * null. This test is significant as it verifies the null handling capabilities of the
 * conversion process. """
